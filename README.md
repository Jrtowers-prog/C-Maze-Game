# C++ Maze Game

This game was completed as an assignment for my software engineering module. 

The game features a controllable player (W,S,A,D / w,s,a,d) and enemies that traverse the maze.

If the enemies catch you, game over.

The objective is to find the key ('K') and once you have it, make your way to the door ('D'). 

Once you have done this, you can exit the maze and you have won.

Good luck!
